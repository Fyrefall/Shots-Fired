---Scenario---
The user may log into the game with a chosen session name or be provided with one if they can't think of one.
This name will joined with a unique ID value for each player.
An Array list of user names and their IDs will be stored on the server.
It doesn't matter if there are duplicate names as the IDs are unique.
There will be a list of sample user names from which a random name will be selected for a user without a name.
These names will be tank generals?
The user will then see the main menu.
The options available will be single player: vs ai and target practice
                              multi player: host and join
                              settings: shows all of the editable settings for the game
At any time the user will be able to go back to the main menu but game settings will be lost.

########################################################################################################
---Single player vs Ai---
The user will play on their local machine against a single ai tank.
The ai will search for the player through trial and error in much the same way as the user will search for the ai's location.
The game will end once either the player or the ai is defeated.

---Single player target practice---
The user will play a game where there are no enemies.
There will be a single target for the user to hit.
The target will change places once it has been hit and the user will gain score.

---Multi player host---
The user will enter a new lobby which will show the lobby ID in the top left corner.
The user will be able to manipulate the game settings on the right hand side of the page.
The user can force to start the game regardless of other players being ready.
(possibly start a timer when a new player joins so that they have time to prepare. Can't force start until all timers have run out)
The user will be able to select when they are ready to play or not.
The user will be able to see which other players are ready or not.
The user will be able to kick other players.

---Multi player join---
The user will enter in a lobby ID as the password to an active lobby.
Once inside the lobby, the user will see their name appear on a list of players in the lobby.
The user will be able to select when they are ready to play or not.
The user will be able to see which other players are ready or not.

---Multi player game play---
depending on the settings of the game, there will be a maximum of two teams or a free for all.
The users' team will be shown as blue tanks, the users' tank will be green while all enemies are red.
The user will be able to adjust their angle and power to hit their enemies.
The user will be able to move their tank as long as they have enough fuel.
The user will be given 30 seconds (depending on settings) to setup their shot.
The user can choose from a selection of weapons for a shot.
The weapons available to the user will have quantities which decrease with usage.
The user can choose to shoot their shot before the timer.
Once all shots for all players on the same team have been made ready, then all of the shots will fire concurrently.

---Settings---
The user will be able to select the key bindings for the game from a predefined list.
The user will be able to choose the colour scheme.
The user may select the background of their choice.

---Weapons---(These use P2 physics)
Name            | Damage    |Likelihood%| Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shot            |10         |90         |A regular shot, weak but available
Nuke            |100        |25         |The nuke is the most powerful weapon in the game. Based on a M.O.A.B
Flower          |20         |75         |The flower is a gentle shot shaped like a flower
Bullet          |12         |80         |The bullets have less gravity as they should be fired more directly?


(with the weapons maybe have separate likelihoods for each weapon spawning amounts.
I don't want a player to find they only have one weapon type to shoot because it is picked all the time
The likelihood should change that and make it random but controlled.)

---Game Structure---
index.html
    This is where all of the javascript files are loaded to the web page.

States
    Boot.js
        Starts the physics engine for the whole game.
        Gets the game ready to be played.
        Loads a loading bar which will be used while downloading the assets and game files.

    Preload.js
        Loads all of the games assets.
        Assets are divided into images, fonts, data and audio.
        Images are divided into sprites and buttons.
        The directory shortcuts are used to reduce redundant code.

    Login.js

    Menu.js

    Lobby.js

    Game.js
        Initialises the game variables and physics.
        Creates the background, groups, timers and input.
        A GUI is created for the game screen.
        The update function handles how the button listeners and the collision detections are handled.

Entities
    Tank.js

    Turret.js

    Projectile.js

    AI.js

---Concepts?---
Posting the players' score on the server
    - High scores section on the menu - shows name, score, date, game mode
Add a trail to each projectile as it moves through the air.
    - The trail would disappear each time a new shot is fired as a new trail would take its place.




######TO-DO#############################################################################################
Add the turn timer and update it constantly
Update all of the labels more efficiently
Add an ai class which is basically a tank but takes different data and has different targeting algorithms
Need an input controller
    Something that will swap between the change of controls for each user
